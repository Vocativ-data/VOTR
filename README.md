# Presidential speech grade level #
----------

The data provided here was used as the backbone of the VOTR piece (seen here: http://goo.gl/F2r9z9).
For each question, we have a variable with binary results (answer keys in top rows).
Data was scraped from multiple sources: personal questions are from the candidates' social media accounts, Wikipedia, campaign and personal websites; Political stances are from Q&As, official campaign stances, interviews; Campaign funding are from the Sunlight foundation.

## Note on data ##
Where data was unavailable, we use "0" as a marker.
